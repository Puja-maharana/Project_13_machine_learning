    "1. Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "2. Machine Learning\n",
    "3. Deep learning\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Artificial Intelligence: It refers to the stimulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans.AI enables machines to perform tasks such as problem solving,decision making,speech recogoniztion and languauage translation which typically use human intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example :\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI bots like Siri and Google assistant which perform human intelligence tasks based on the way we speak.\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGpt is also an example AI which posseses human intelligence and perform tasks based on the input we provide\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning : \n",
    "    It is the subset of AI which involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that invloves computers which allows computers to learn from experience without being mannually programmed/instructed . The system learns from the data and make predictions or decisions based on the patterns and insights found on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Consider Email spam filtering system here instead of hard-coding rules for identifying spam emails, a machine learning algorithm can be trained on a dataset of labeled emails (spam or non-spam) and then the algorithm learns to recognize patterns and characteristics associated with spam emails, allowing it to automatically classify future emails as spam or not.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Deep Learning :\n",
    "    It is a specialized subset of Machine Learning that uses neural networks to model and solve complex problems and is particularly effective in handling large amounts of unstructered data such as images,audio and text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example;\n",
    "\n",
    "    Image recognition is a common application of deep learning. Here a deep learning model called a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be trained to identify objects in images. By feeding the network a vast dataset of labeled images, it learns to recognize features and patterns in the images. Once trained, the CNN can accurately identify objects in new, unseen images, even if the objects have slight variations in position or appearance.\n",

    "Q2. What is Supervised Learning? Give some examples of Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "    Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on labelled dataset ie. each input in the training data is associated with the corresponding correct output.During the training the algorithm learns to map inputs to the correct outputs and once trained it can make predictions on the new input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of supervised learning are :\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Email Spam Classification : The algorithm is trained on a dataset of emails labeled as spam or not spam. It learns to distinguish between the two labels spam and non-spam emails and can be used to classify new incoming emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Sentiment Analysis : In this, the algorithm is trained on a dataset of text documents (e.g., customer reviews) along with their associated sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral). The algorithm learns to predict the sentiments of new text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  House Price Prediction : Say we are given a dataset of houses with features like square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc., along with their actual sale prices, a supervised learning algorithm can be trained to predict the prices of new houses based on their existing features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Image Classification: A dataset of images with corresponding labels indicating the objects present in the images (e.g., cats, dogs, table, chair , etc.), a supervised learning algorithm can be trained to classify new images into these categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised Learning the key aspect is that the training data is labeled, allowing the algorithm to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs and make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is Unsupervised Learning? Give Some examples of Unsupervised Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Unsupervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithmn is trained on an unlabelled dataset ie. the data does not have corresponding output labels.The goal of unsupervised learning is to find patterns structures and relationships within the data without explicint guidance.Here,instead of predicting specific outputs the algorithm attempts to identify inherit structures and groupings in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Unsupervised Learning are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer Segmentation : This comes under the catergory of Clustering .Here the algorithm groups the similar data points together based on thier inherit charecteristics. Say for example we are using kmeans clustering algorithm here the data is divided into k cluster each representing its centeroid. Here customers are grouped on bases of specific metrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fraud Detection : This comes under category of anomaly detection.Here unsupervised Learning can be used to detect outliers in the data .The algorithm learns patterns from majority of the data and detects the points that deviate from the patterns obtained from the majority of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality Reduction : This techinque aims to reduce the number of features in the dataset while peserving the important information.Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a common unsupervised learning method used for dimensionality reduction. It helps in visualizing high-dimensional data, compressing data for efficient storage, and improving the performance of other machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is the difference between AI, ML, DL, and DS?\n",
    "\n",
    "AI is the broader field of creating intelligent systems\n",
    "ML is a subset of AI focused on learning from data\n",
    "DL is a specialized technique within ML using deep neural networks\n",
    "DS is an interdisciplinary field that involves working with data to gain insights and make data-driven decisions."
